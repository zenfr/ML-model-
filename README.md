Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classified, By leveraging a diverse dataset, the model aims to provide insights and predictions that can assist in early detection and diagnosis. and the goal is to meet the AUC more than 94% using this model which exceeding the goal is 89% using previous model.

# Data
the data is using [Uploading ground_truth.csvâ€¦](these datasets).

# Results and Evaluation

We have evaluated the model using standard evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results of the evaluation, along with any additional insights or visualizations, can be found in the results directory.

# Contribution

We welcome contributions to enhance the performance, efficiency, or usability of the model. If you would like to contribute.

## Happy coding!
